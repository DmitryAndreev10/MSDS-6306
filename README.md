# MSDS 6306 Homework Repository
This repo was created to upload and store my submissions for homework assignments in the SMU MSDS 6306 Spring 2018 class.

There are seperate folders to store the required documents for the homework assignments and any supporting files. For example the folder titled 'Unit 1' represents the homework documents for the unit / module completed in the course during week 1. Unit 2 represents the homework documents for week 2 and so on in sequential order.

A summary for the homework assignments is listed below and will be updated as new files are uploaded to the repo:

#### Unit 1 - Using R for basic math operations, random number generation, vector operations, creating a Data Science profile

#### Unit 2 - Creating an RMarkdown document and formatting it, creating scatter plots 

#### Unit 3 - Using Git and GitHub, importing data into R, and building function in R

#### Unit 4 - Using FiveThirtyEight package, apply commands to data frame, creating barplots, uploading local repo to GitHub

Note: Each Unit folder has a txt and R file containing my progress through the assigned modules in the R Swirl script.
