# MSDS 6306 Homework Repository
This repository was created to upload and store my submissions for homework assignments in the SMU MSDS 6306 Spring 2018 class

There are seperate folders to store the required documents for the homework assignments and any supporting files. For example the folder titled 'Unit 1' represents the homework documents for the unit / module completed in the course during week 1. Unit 2 represents the homework documents for week 2 and so on in sequential order.

## Unit 1 - 

## Unit 2

## Unit 3

## Unit 4

To get a summary for the individual homework assignments refer to README.md files contained within folder of interest.

For any questions or concerns regarding this repository please contact Dmitry Andreev at DmitryAndreev10@gmail.com


Create a README.md file which explains the purpose of the repository, the topics included, the sources for the material you post, and contact information in case of questions. Remember, the one in the root directory should be general.  You are welcome to make short READMEs for each assignment individually in other folders.
